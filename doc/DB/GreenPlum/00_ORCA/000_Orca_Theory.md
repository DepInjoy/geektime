# 架构

## Memo
> The Memo structure consists of a set of containers called groups, where each group contains logically equivalent expressions. Memo groups capture the different sub-goals of a query (e.g., a filter on a table, or a join of two tables). Group members, called group expressions, achieve the group goal in different logical ways

## Search and Job Scheduler
> Orca uses a search mechanism to navigate through the space of possible plan alternatives and <b><font color=FA8072>identify the plan with the least estimated cost</font></b>. The search mechanism is enabled by a specialized Job Scheduler that creates dependent or parallel work units to perform query optimization in three main steps: <b><font color=FA8072>exploration</font></b>, where equivalent logical expressions are generated, <b><font color=FA8072>implementation</font></b> where physical plans are generated, and <b><font color=FA8072>optimization</font></b>, where required physical properties (e.g., sort order) are enforced and plan alternatives are costed.

## Transformations
> Plan alternatives are generated by applying transformation rules that can produce either equivalent logical expressions (e.g., InnerJoin(A,B) → InnerJoin(B,A)), or physical implementations of existing expressions (e.g., Join(A,B) → HashJoin(A,B)).
